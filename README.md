# [CKAN][] Feature Ideas and Roadmap

We use the [github issue tracker here][issues] as a place to:

* Suggest new ideas and features for [CKAN][]
* Prioritize these into a Roadmap for future "core" [CKAN][] work

We emphasize that ideas don't just have to be about improvements to the [core CKAN software][core] - for example, the idea of creating a new phone app client for CKAN would be perfect thing to submit.
