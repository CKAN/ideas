# [CKAN][] Feature Ideas and Roadmap

We use the [issue tracker of this github repo][issues] to manage the [CKAN Roadmap][roadmap]. This includes both:

* Suggesting new ideas and features for [CKAN][]
* Prioritizing these into a Roadmap for future "core" [CKAN][] work

We emphasize that ideas don't just have to be about improvements to the [core CKAN software][core] - for example, the idea of creating a new phone app client for CKAN would be perfect thing to submit.

If you want to know more about [CKAN][] and its Roadmap process see: <http://ckan.org/roadmap/>
